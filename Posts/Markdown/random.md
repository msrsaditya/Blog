Yes, `href="../../"` is **valid** in an `<a>` tag. Here's what it means:

### ✅ What it does:

`../../` is a **relative path** that tells the browser to:

1. Go **up one directory** (`..`)
2. Then **up another directory** (`..`)
3. Then look for the **default file (like `index.html`)** in that location

### Example:

Suppose your file is located at:

```
/home/user/website/pages/articles/article1.html
```

And you use:

```html
<a href="../../">Back to root</a>
```

That would resolve to:

```
/home/user/website/
```

It will open the default file in that directory (like `index.html`), if it exists.

### ✔️ Usage is valid if:

* The referenced directory exists.
* There's an `index.html` or another default file to open.

### ❌ It will not work properly if:

* You don't have access to that level (e.g., in some web hosts).
* There’s no default document in that folder.

Let me know your directory structure if you want to double-check if it’s correct in your context.
