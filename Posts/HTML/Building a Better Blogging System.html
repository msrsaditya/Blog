        <p>I had grown increasingly frustrated with Jekyll. Not just with Jekyll itself, but with what it represented - the growing tendency in modern software development to accept complexity as a necessary evil. Every time I wanted to write a blog post, I found myself wrestling with Ruby gems, dealing with dependency issues, and spending more time managing the system than actually writing. As a software purist who believes in the fundamental Unix principles, this felt wrong.</p>
<p>The breaking point came when I realized that the mental bandwidth I was spending on context-switching and system maintenance was actively hindering my writing process. I wanted to focus on expressing ideas, not managing a complex publishing pipeline. This led me to ask: What would a blogging system look like if it were built according to the Unix philosophy?</p>
<h2 id="the-unix-way">The Unix Way</h2>
<p>The Unix philosophy, articulated by Doug McIlroy, emphasizes writing programs that do one thing and do it well, programs that work together, and programs that handle text streams as a universal interface. This approach has proven its worth over decades, yet we often ignore it in favor of more “modern” solutions.</p>
<p>Instead of accepting the complexity of Jekyll, I decided to build a system using tools that have stood the test of time: - Bash for orchestration - pandoc for Markdown conversion - entr for file watching - sed for text manipulation - git for version control</p>
<p>Each of these tools does one thing exceptionally well, and they’ve been doing it reliably for years. By combining them thoughtfully, we can create something both powerful and maintainable.</p>
<h2 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h2>
<p>The core of the system is a Bash script that coordinates these tools into a seamless workflow. When you run it, it: 1. Sets up a clean workspace with proper directory structure 2. Creates necessary Markdown and HTML files 3. Opens your preferred editor (in my case, Neovim) for writing 4. Establishes a live preview in your browser 5. Handles the conversion and publishing process</p>
<p>The magic happens in how these pieces work together. While you write in Markdown, entr watches for changes and triggers pandoc to convert your content to HTML. A simple AppleScript refreshes your browser, giving you instant feedback. When you’re ready to publish, a single keystroke handles Git commits and pushes.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This isn’t just about building a blog system. It’s about challenging the assumption that more complex solutions are necessarily better. My system: - Has zero dependency management headaches - Requires no configuration beyond initial setup - Will likely still work perfectly a decade from now - Lets me focus entirely on writing - Costs nothing to run</p>
<p>Most importantly, it follows the principle that “whatever can be done simpler, should be done simpler.” This isn’t about minimalism for its own sake - it’s about building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and focused on their core purpose.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-details">The Technical Details</h2>
<p>The system consists of a few key components: - A main Bash script (blog.sh) that handles the workflow - HTML and CSS templates for consistent styling - A directory structure that separates content from presentation - A simple but effective preview system</p>
<p>The script creates a temporary converter that watches for changes and handles the Markdown-to-HTML conversion. This approach means there’s no background daemon to manage, no server to configure, and no build system to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="the-broader-lesson">The Broader Lesson</h2>
<p>This project reinforced something I’ve long believed: the best tools often aren’t the ones with the most features or the largest community. They’re the ones that do one thing well and can be composed with other tools to create powerful systems.</p>
<p>Jekyll isn’t a bad tool, but it represents a development philosophy that I believe has led us astray - one where we accept complexity and heavy dependencies as the cost of doing business. My experience shows that by returning to Unix principles and embracing simplicity, we can build systems that are not just adequate, but superior in many ways to their more complex counterparts.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>This system isn’t just about saving time or avoiding Ruby gems. It’s about building tools that respect both the user and the Unix philosophy. Tools that are simple, reliable, and focused. Tools that “always work” because they’re built on foundations that have proven themselves over decades.</p>
<p>In an era where software complexity seems to grow exponentially, sometimes the best path forward is to step back and ask: What’s the simplest thing that could possibly work? Often, as in this case, the answer lies in combining existing, well-tested tools in thoughtful ways rather than building something new and complex.</p>
<p>As for me? I’m back to focusing on writing, which was the whole point in the first place. And isn’t that what good software should do - get out of your way and let you focus on what matters?</p>
