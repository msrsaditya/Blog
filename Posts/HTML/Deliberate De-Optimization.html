<p>Question: How much should you care about things?<br />
Answer: I’m unsure exactly, but I know that it’s not the absolute maximum amount for everything all the time.<br />
- Oliver Burkeman</p>

<p>Chris Williamson discussed this extensively on <a href="https://x.com/ChrisWillx/status/1802737038174687394">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCe41-I4AIM">YouTube</a>, so I’m not going to regurgitate what he already said.</p>
<p>TLDR:</p>
<p>Optimization is making things better to get better results. Over-optimization is making more things better and still getting diminishing results. Deliberate De-Optimization is trying to keep as many things as they already are, to avoid getting diminishing results.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Intellectuals on the internet are completely obsessed with optimization stuff, and we have no shortage of influencers to promote this.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, most of the stuff they talk about is scientifically sound, I’m not concerned about the “what” but rather the “why”.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> asks us to focus on the 20% of the stuff that gets 80% of the results.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-really-all-worth-it">Is it really all worth it?</h2>
<p>That carefully planned 6 PM bedtime routine, all those ice baths, supplements, biohacking, notion templates, to-do lists, podcasts, books, subscriptions, 2000+ extra tools to make you productive and bla bla bla… Are they all really worth it?</p>
<p>What is that 20% of stuff that’s going to get you 80% of the results?</p>
<p>From personal experience (and from evolutionary psychology and common sense), for most people it’s probably mostly their work that’s going to get them the 80% of the results (inside the overall 80% of results, so 64%) and the rest of the 20% (16%) comes from basic things like diet (don’t eat junk, eat balanced diet) and exercise along with a little bit of family (or friends) time.</p>
<p>That extra productivity app on your phone to measure how much your little fingernail has grown today is not going to improve your life drastically.</p>
<p>We only have so much bandwidth to do stuff. Constantly trying to optimize stuff itself becomes an inefficiency that we need to optimize (ironically).</p>
<p>This type of stuff mainly attracts the mid-guys on the IQ bell curve.</p>
<p><img src="Bell%20Curve.png" /></p>
<p>The dumb guys don’t understand it, and the smart guys know what’s wrong with it. Ignorance might really be bliss.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-wrong">Is it Wrong?</h2>
<p>It’s that sort of thing where it’s hard to say it’s wrong to do it.</p>
<p>Will waking up at the exact time your REM cycle ends going to be healthy and productive for you? Will eating 420.69 calories every meal help you increase your metabolism? Will listening to 42 podcasts every day make you smarter?</p>
<p>I don’t know, maybe, but what are you giving up for it? Why can’t you just wake up at 6 AM normally without an alarm, eat home-cooked food, and spend time with family like any sane person does, just for, I don’t know, peace of mind?</p>
<p>So that you don’t have this pressure of failing? So you won’t feel the guilt from perfectionism? So you have fewer things to manage?</p>
<p>There’s an old cliche post I used to see on Facebook that I think everyone needs to remember again:</p>
<p><img src="Mark.jpg" /></p>
<p>It’s not about simplicity or minimalism; it’s about having fewer things to care about.</p>
<p>I don’t want to make “more” choices. I already have a lot of choices that I need to make at work or during family situations or anything else that I can’t avoid, so why should I add more? What do I get in return? If it’s 5% returns for 95% effort, I’m out!</p>
<p>Also, don’t irritate me with this Atomic Habits’ 1.01^365=37.8 bullshit. It assumes you grow 0.01 every day with more and more good habits, which you not only certainly won’t grow but rather go the other way around.</p>
