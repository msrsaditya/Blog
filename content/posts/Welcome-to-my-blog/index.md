Hi, I'm Shashank. I created this blog to share my thoughts about... everything? Mostly tech, philosophy, and life, I guess.

I think the world is going to be fundamentally changed because of AI. I think the dead internet theory is going to be ever more real than it is right now because of this.

And authenticity is ever more important in such a world. So, I want to write this blog without using any AI (well, kinda).

I don't think completely abandoning AI is such a wise choice. LLMs are pretty useful IMHO. They are amazing judges, fact checkers, assistants and so on... (for the most part).

The way I like to use AI, though, is like a companion, like a critique, like an unbiased judge. I sometimes give Claude pieces of stuff I write and ask it to analyze it and tell me about the "Author" (so it doesn't know it's me, sycophantism is real in LLMs!).

I'm sure many more people also do this, nothing new. I think it helps us get an honest assessment of ourselves from a 3rd person perspective. And Claude is pretty good at giving balanced takes for everything, accounting for nuance (at least when compared to the regular Joe).

And sometimes if my thoughts aren't that clear, I just pour all of that into Claude and ask for its thoughts, and it does a pretty good job of synthesizing everything and steering me towards the center if my views were ever too "dramatic".

And here too, I don't think it would be my best version if I write this blog without using AI (no scrutiny), and I don't think it's going to be any helpful if I just let the AI write everything (the human experience is novel and we are yet to define the word consciousness properly, let alone understand it).

So we'll have the best of both worlds. I'll be the thinking one, starting with the premises I feel correct, using axioms I feel intuitive, and then let the AI critique me so I can get out of my bubble.

I don't know where this lands or how it's going to turn out, but at the very least, I'm hoping it will serve as a personal diary for all my youth.

That's all.
